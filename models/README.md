# Models

## Description
The /models folder stores any files that transform inputs into outputs (notebook, Python, SQL files)

## Notebooks
"__pipeline__.ipynb" should be used to orchestrate the execution of all files.
"IMO_template.ipynb" should be used to kick start a new notebook in your models.
