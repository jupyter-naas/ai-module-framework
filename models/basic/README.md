# Models - Basic

## Overview
The /models/basic folder is designed to hold notebooks that can be used to quickly start working on your data product. To get started, you can navigate to the  __templates__ folder and copy and paste any of the notebooks you want to use.

## Triggering Notebook Execution

### Schedulers

You can use the naas.scheduler feature to automate your notebook execution at specific intervals. This allows you to ensure that your data product is updated regularly and consistently. You can refer to [our documentation](https://docs.naas.ai/features/scheduler) on how to schedule your notebooks using `naas.scheduler` feature or use the templates provided in the Naas folder in our [awesome-notebooks repository](https://github.com/jupyter-naas/awesome-notebooks/tree/master/Naas).

### Webhooks

Using `naas.webhook` feature, you can trigger notebook execution inside a third-party tool or by a human clicking on the Naas link or using our Chrome extension. This allows for more flexibility in how you trigger your notebook executions. To learn more about how to use naas.webhook feature, you can refer to [our documentation](https://docs.naas.ai/features/webhook) or use the templates provided in the Naas folder in our [awesome-notebooks repository](https://github.com/jupyter-naas/awesome-notebooks/tree/master/Naas).
